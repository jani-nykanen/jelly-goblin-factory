## Play

## Building (LINUX ONLY!)

If you really want to play the current development version, run `makemake.sh` to build a make file (you may have to replace python3 with python etc), then `make` to build the binary. A binary called "out" should appear.

Making a Windows binary is possible, but a little tricky right now, you have to edit the makefile a little. (I'm not going to pass the details here, since I see no reason to rebuild the Windows binary)
